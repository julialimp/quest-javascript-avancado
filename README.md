## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for submit button
- See an alert if the user name is not filled
- See a message if user doesn't exist
- See user infos, such as:
    - Name
    - Bio
    - Number of followers
    - Number of following
    - List of a maximum of ten repositories with their respectives links
    - 10 most recent events

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Fetch API

### What I learned

In this project I was able to practice a little more of import / export funcions and variables and how to link them, and also the innerHTML property. Besides that, I could develop more know-how about the API's, using fetch to bring the data and accessing their content to make it appear on the page.

### Continued development

Practicing is very important when talking about coding and problem solving. I can see that the more I practice, the easier and faster it is to see a solution to some kind of error that might happen.
